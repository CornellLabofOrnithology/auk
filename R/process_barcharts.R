#' Process eBird bar chart data
#' 
#' eBird bar charts show the frequency of detection for each week for all
#' species within a region. These can be accessed by visiting any region or
#' hotspot page and clicking the "Bar Charts" link in the left column. As an
#' example, these [bar charts for
#' Guatemala](https://ebird.org/barchart?r=GT&yr=all&m=) list all the species
#' (as well as non-species taxa) that have been observed in eBird in Guatemala
#' and, for each species, the width of the green bar reflects the frequency of
#' detections on eBird checklists within the region (referred to as detection
#' frequency). Detection frequency is provide for each of 4 "weeks" of each
#' month (although these are not technically 7 day weeks since months have more
#' than 28 days). The data underlying the bar charts can be downloaded via a
#' link at the bottom right of the page; however, the text file that's
#' downloaded is in a challenging format to work with. This function is designed
#' to read these text files and return a nicely formatted data frame for use in
#' R.
#'
#' @param filename character; path to the bar chart data text file downloaded
#'   from the eBird website.
#'
#' @return This functions returns a data frame in long format where each row
#'   provides data for one species in one week. `detection_frequency` gives the
#'   proportion of checklists in the region that reported the species in the
#'   given week and `n_detections` gives the number of detections. The total
#'   number of checklists in each week used to estimate detection frequency is
#'   provided as a data frame stored in the `sample_sizes` attribute.
