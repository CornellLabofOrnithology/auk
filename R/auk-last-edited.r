#' Filter the EBD by last edited date
#'
#' Define a filter for the eBird Basic Dataset (EBD) based on a range of last
#' edited dates. Last edited date is typically used to extract just new or
#' recently edited data. This function only defines the filter and, once all
#' filters have been defined, [auk_filter()] should be used to call AWK and
#' perform the filtering.
#'
#' @param x `auk_ebd` object; reference to EBD file created by [auk_ebd()].
#' @param date character or date; date range to filter by, provided either as a
#'   character vector in the format `"2015-12-31"` or a vector of Date objects.
#'
#' @return An `auk_ebd` object.
