Description: Extract and process bird sightings records from eBird 
    (<http://ebird.org/>), an onlnine tool for recording bird observations. 
    Public access to the full eBird database is via the eBird Basic Dataset 
    (EBD; see <http://ebird.org/ebird/data/download> for access), a downloadable 
    text file. This package is an interface to AWK for extracting data from the 
    EBD based on taxonomic, spatial, or temporal filters, to produce a 
    manageable file size that can be imported into R.
