\title{Reference to EBD file}
\usage{
auk_ebd(file, file_sampling, sep = "\\t")
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{character; input file.}

\item{file_sampling}{character; optional input sampling event data file,
required if you intend to zero-fill the data to produce a presence-absence
data set. The sampling file consists of just effort information for every
eBird checklist. Any species not appearing in the EBD for a given checklist
is implicitly considered to have a count of 0. This file should be
downloaded at the same time as the EBD to ensure they are in sync.}

\item{sep}{character; the input field separator, the EBD is tab separated so
this should generally not be modified. Must only be a single character and
space delimited is not allowed since spaces appear in many of the fields.}
}
\value{
An \code{auk_ebd} object storing the file reference and the desired
filters once created with other package functions.
}
\description{
Create a reference to an eBird Basic Dataset (EBD) file in preparation for
filtering using AWK.
}
\details{
The EBD can be downloaded as a tab-separated text file from the
\href{http://ebird.org/ebird/data/download}{eBird website} after submitting a
request for access. As of February 2017, this file is nearly 150 GB making
it challenging to work with. If you're only interested in a single species
or a small region it is possible to submit a custom download request. This
approach is suggested to speed up processing time.

There are two potential pathways for preparing eBird data. Users wishing to
produce presence only data, should download the \href{http://ebird.org/ebird/data/download/}{eBird Basic Dataset}
and reference this file when calling \code{auk_ebd()}. Users wishing to produce
zero-filled, presence absence data should additionally download the sampling
event data file associated with the EBD. This file contains only checklist
information and can be used to infer absences. The sampling event data file
should be provided to \code{auk_ebd()} via the \code{file_sampling} argument. For
further details consult the vignettes.

\examples{
# set up reference to sample EBD file
f <- system.file("extdata/ebd-sample.txt", package = "auk")
auk_ebd(f)
# to produce zero-filled data, provide a sampling event data file
f_ebd <- system.file("extdata/zerofill-ex_ebd.txt", package = "auk")
f_smpl <- system.file("extdata/zerofill-ex_sampling.txt", package = "auk")
auk_ebd(f_ebd, file_sampling = f_smpl)
