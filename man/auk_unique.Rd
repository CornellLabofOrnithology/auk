\title{Remove duplicate group checklists}
\usage{
auk_unique(x, group_id = "group_identifier",
  checklist_id = "sampling_event_identifier",
  species_id = "scientific_name", checklists_only = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data.frame; the EBD data frame, typically as imported by
\code{\link[=read_ebd]{read_ebd()}}.}

\item{group_id}{character; the name of the group ID column.}

\item{checklist_id}{character; the name of the checklist ID column, each
checklist within a group will get a unique value for this field. The record
with the lowest \code{checklist_id} will be picked as the unique record within
each group.}

\item{species_id}{character; the name of the column identifying species
uniquely. This is required to ensure that removing duplicates is done
independently for each species. Note that this will not treat sub-species
independently and, if that behavior is desired, the user will have to
generate a column uniquely identifying species and subspecies and pass that
column's name to this argument.}

\item{checklists_only}{logical; whether the dataset provided only contains
checklist information as with the sampling event data file. If this
argument is \code{TRUE}, then the \code{species_id} argument is ignored and removing
of duplicated is done at the checklist level not the species level.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with unique observations, and an additional field,
\code{checklist_id}, which is a combination of the sampling event and group IDs.
}
\description{
eBird checklists can be shared among a group of multiple observers, in which
case observations will be duplicated in the database. This functions removes
these duplicates from the eBird Basic Dataset (EBD) or the EBD sampling event
data (with \code{checklists_only = TRUE}), creating a set of unique bird
observations. This function is called automatically by \code{\link[=read_ebd]{read_ebd()}} and
\code{\link[=read_sampling]{read_sampling()}}.
}
\details{
This function chooses the checklist within in each that has the
lowest value for the field specified by \code{checklist_id}. A new column is
also created, \code{checklist_id}, whose value is the taken from the field
specified in the \code{checklist_id} parameter for non-group checklists and from
the field specified by the \code{group_id} parameter for grouped checklists.

\examples{
# read in an ebd file and don't automatically remove duplicates
ebd <- system.file("extdata/ebd-sample.txt", package = "auk") \%>\%
  read_ebd(unique = FALSE)
# remove duplicates
ebd_unique <- auk_unique(ebd)
nrow(ebd)
nrow(ebd_unique)
}
