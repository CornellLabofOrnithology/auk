\description{
eBird users have the option of specifying breeding bird atlas codes for their
observations, for example, if nesting building behaviour is observered. Use
this filter to select only those observations with an associated breeding
code. This function only defines the filter and, once all filters have been
defined, \code{\link[=auk_filter]{auk_filter()}} should be used to call AWK and perform the filtering.
